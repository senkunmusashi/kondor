# Kondor


### 1. What is Kondor?
Kondor is an open source LCD (mask) 3D printer firmware started by 2 team members of Peopoly (the makers of the Moai SLA 3D printer). Our goal is to create a flexible firmware that can run on different types of boards and is ideal for experimentation and customization.   

Here are the key features:
-    Drive 2 LCDs via SPI + HDMI that improves performance. 
-    Easy to get and low-cost components.  
-    Runs on Pi3. 
-    Able to output 4K resolution. 
-    C++ core. 
-    Ability to drive DLP (but not at initial launch.)

Launch Step:
-    To share the Bill Of Materials (BOM) and software image for Pi3 for public testing. 
-    To clean up initial code, bugfixes and improvements as needed for a stable release. 
-    Ultimately, when the firmware is deemed stable and optimised, release source codes.  

I also want to take this chance to share with you why we started this project: 

We want to give back to the open source community because we learned from projects like Marlin, Cura, and others.
We believe there should be more open source projects launched by Asian developers and we want to do our fair share.

While the project is launched by 2 guys from Asia, it belongs to the world. Join us to have some fun printing, testing and pushing the project forward.

### 2. How to use Kondor.

The first stage is to make sure testers have a Pi3B and can connect the slicer to the firmware.
